The Grove - Gas Sensor(MQ5) module is useful for gas leakage detection (in home and industry). It can detect LPG, natural gas, town gas and so on. Because it has a fast response time once it has pre-heated, measurements are almost instantaneous. Note that the sensitivity can be adjusted by the potentiometer.
### Usage:

Just open this ino file with Arduino IDE and play.

Assume that you connected the grove correctly.
